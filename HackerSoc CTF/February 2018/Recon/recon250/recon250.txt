Hint: Many online tools strip metadata, instead try writing/finding a script.


Solution

Decode Base64, visit link, decode Base64, decode Brainfuck, decode Base64, visit link, decode Base64 into a file, try common passwords on the PDF (first link on Google).

Password is: 123456
Flag is: flag{_#;-%%^,<~S]]_}
