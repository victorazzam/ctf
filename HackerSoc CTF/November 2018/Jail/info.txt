The code evaluates user input as follows:
• Accept no more than 50 characters
• Remove any instances of letters f g l or t
• Evaluate the remaining string as code
• Print the result if successful

To solve this challenge, find a string no more than 50 in length that can open the file flag.txt and show its contents.

The file I/O part is solved with a simple open().read() statement, where open() opens the file in read mode and .read() returns the file contents.

Since "flag.txt" contains all of the banned letters, another way to replicate it is to use hex strings.

Replace every character in "flag.txt" with "\x" followed by that character's hex value in the ASCII table.

open("\x66\x6c\x61\x67\x2e\x74\x78\x74").read()
